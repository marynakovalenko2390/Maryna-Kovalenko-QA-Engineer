# Postman Collection

This repository contains a Postman collection organized into 5 folders, each representing a group of related API requests.

# Collection-level Scripts

# Pre-request scripts: Executed before requests at the collection level. These scripts can be reused by requests as needed.
Examples include:

 -User registration pre-request script

-Creating an article

-Following a user

-Creating a second user

-Creating comments

# Post-response scripts: Executed after requests at the collection level to validate responses. These scripts can also be called at the request level.
Examples include:

-Checking response status code

-Validating response time

-Verifying response properties

-Request-level Script Usage

Collection-level scripts can be called at the request level whenever needed.

This allows for reusable logic across multiple requests without duplicating code.

# Benefits

-Centralized script management (pre-request and post-response scripts)

-Reusable scripts for common tasks

-Easy to maintain and extend
